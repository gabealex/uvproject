		<h2>Who We Are</h2>
		<p>Since 2003, The Uganda Village Project (UVP) has been working with the people of Iganga to promote public health and sustainable development in the rural communities of this marginalized district in southeast Uganda. Our organization represents a network of partnerships bridging disciplines and sectors. As an international nonprofit organization, we work directly with community based organizations (CBOs) and local government to utilize local knowledge and maximize community ownership of public health and development solutions.</p>
		<p>To learn more, please watch the video below, explore the rest of our site, and contact us if you have any questions.</p>

	<div id='whatWeDo' class="container">
		<h2>What We Do</h2>
		<p>With the help of our partners in the field, Uganda Village Project (UVP) has identified the following core programmatic areas of focus.</p>
		<div id='healthyvillages' class="col-xs-4">
			<div id='overlay1' class="col-xs-4">
				<h4>Healthy Villages</h4>
		<p>This initiative unifies UVP’s various health projects and advocacy work to provide rural health care and promote public health on a village level. Through community organizing and mobilization, this approach targets the primary health risks of the region by providing education, training and appropriate interventions to Village Health Team members, health center workers, local community leaders, and the general population.</p></div></div>

		<div id='safewater' class="col-xs-4">
			<div id='overlay2' class="col-xs-4">
				<h4>Safe Water</h4>
		<p>UVP’s approach to safe water sources maximizes community ownership and minimizes the need for external funding. It has been highly successful in meeting the pressing needs for water in Iganga District.</p></div></div>

		<div id='obfi' class="col-xs-4">
			<div id='overlay3' class="col-xs-4">
			<h4>Obstetric Fistula</h4>
		<p>Fistula is one of the most devastating childbirth injuries. Prolonged obstructed labor can cause a hole in the birth canal which results in constant incontinence for the woman, isolating her from friends, family, and community. UVP promotes fistula awareness and prevention through community outreaches and brings women for surgery to heal their injury.</p></div></div>
	</div>
	<div id='whereWeWork' class="container">
		<h2>Where We Work</h2>
		<p>With a population approaching 700,000, Iganga District is one of the most densely populated of Uganda.  In spite of that fact, Iganga District boasts only one town, Iganga town, which for a long time was the largest in the country without running water or public sewage systems.</p>

		<p>Located in the middle of the Busoga region of the Basoga people, Iganga District is one of the more marginalized of the country and as a result it is among the poorest. Lusoga, a Bantu language closely related to the national language, Luganda, is what most people in the region speak. Those who attend formal schooling, particularly secondary school, also learn English as well as formal Luganda. The rural economy of Iganga depends heavily on maize, potatoes, and sugar cane.</p>
