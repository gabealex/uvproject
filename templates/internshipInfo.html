	<h2>Internship Info</h2>
	<p>Interns are placed in a six-member team structure with a co-leadership model from one national (Ugandan) intern and one international intern. Teams live and work together in the same village. Each team has four internationals and two Ugandans</p>
	<p>UVP interns are placed in rural villages surrounding Iganga District. The practicum supervisor stays in town. You will have the opportunity for three formal meetings throughout the internship (beginning, middle, and end) with the practicum supervisor to review your goals and work. Additional meetings can be scheduled as needed and the supervisor will be making site visits and observing work in the village periodically throughout the internship period.</p>
	<div id="OffersOrDoesnt">
		<p><strong>The UVP internship offers:</strong></p>
		<p><i>Practical on-the-ground experience in public health work in the rural village setting</i><br />
			Interns will focus their time on understanding the community, community mobilization, creating and implementing creative education sessions, qualitative and quantitative data collection, report writing, teamwork and communication on an international team. </p>
		<p><i>Data to use in further school work</i><br />
			If you are interesting in using data that you collect for UVP during the course of the internship or other UVP data for use in other course work, the practicum supervisor would be happy to work with you. 	</p>
		<p>&nbsp;<br />
			<strong>The UVP internship does NOT offer:</strong></p>
		<p><i>8 weeks to focus on your own research project</i><br />
			UVP has a set of activities and deliverables for each intern team and expects that all team members will contribute equally in completing them. UVP work is generally Monday through Friday from 9-5. Interns are welcome to explore other interests outside of the internship in their free time. If you are thinking about conducting research in the villages where you will be staying, please communicate with the UVP practicum supervisor before coming to Uganda. </p>
		<p><i>Daily access to internet</i><br />
			Internet access is limited in Iganga and will be available from cafes if you travel into town on the weekends. Internet at the UVP office in town can be used for schoolwork if arranged beforehand with the practicum supervisor. This can be difficult for practicum students with strict timelines and deliverables required from their school. Please notify your school and request to extend deadlines.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;<br />
			Still not sure if the UVP internship is right for your practicum requirement?<br />
			Feel free to email the UVP Managing Director, Kelly, at kelly@ugandavillageproject.org with further questions. </p>

	<h3>Security:</h3>

	<p>Uganda Village Project makes intern safety a priority. For general information about the security situation in Uganda, please see the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/uganda.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/uganda.html', 'US State Department website']);"  target="_blank">US State Department website</a>. At this time there are no <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html', 'travel warnings or alerts']);"  target="_blank">travel warnings or alerts</a> for Uganda.</p>
	<p>If a serious incident occurs within Iganga District or one that has wide-ranging implications that could impact Iganga District during the internship, we will contact all team members by phone and publish a blog with the status and next steps so that family members have current information about intern security. We regularly review all information that is published from the US Embassy or local sources and will contact team leaders at once about any relevant security updates and the UVP response.  Generally, protests or other potential disruptions are isolated to Kampala and other sizable cities, but we will brief team leaders at each weekly meeting if there are any reports throughout the country to ensure all interns are informed. </p>
	<p>*****</p>
	<p>If as an intern or a family member, you have any concerns about safety and security in Uganda, please contact our Board Chair, Alison Hayward at <a href="mailto:alison@ugandavillageproject.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','mailto','alison@ugandavillageproject.org']);" >alison@ugandavillageproject.org</a>, or our Executive Director, Leslie Stroud-Romero, at <a href="mailto:leslie@ugandavillageproject.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','mailto','leslie@ugandavillageproject.org']);" >leslie@ugandavillageproject.org</a>.
