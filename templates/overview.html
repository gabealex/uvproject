<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p style="padding-bottom:150px;">Since 2003, The Uganda Village Project (UVP) has been working with the people of Iganga to promote public health and sustainable development in the rural communities of this marginalized district in southeast Uganda. Our organization represents a network of partnerships bridging disciplines and sectors. As an international nonprofit organization, we work directly with community based organizations (CBOs) and local government to utilize local knowledge and maximize community ownership of public health and development solutions.</p>
