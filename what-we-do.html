  <h1>What We Do</h1>
    <p>With the help of our partners in the field, Uganda Village Project (UVP) has identified the following core programmatic areas of focus.</p></div>
</header>
	<div id = "header" class= "container">
		<div id='HV' class="col-xs-12">
			<h3>Healthy Villages</h3>
			
			<p>"Healthy Villages" is an innovative, grassroots approach to addressing rural healthcare and public health in Uganda. Its goal is to improve the provision of healthcare and of preventative health education to underserved populations across rural Iganga District.  Healthy Villages targets the primary health risks of the region at a village-by-village level, in partnership with the District Health Office of Iganga, the Sub-County officials, and the local Health Center staff.</p>

			<p>We launched Healthy Villages in five villages during the summer of 2009. To choose which villages to work in, we partnered with the District Health Office to identify communities that fell into the bottom quartile in sanitation and access to clean water in the district. We use this as our proxy for the most underserved villages in Iganga District, and continue to expand each year in the 70 identified villages. We work in each village for three years, building capacity within the community before acknowledging their accomplishments with a graduation ceremony.</p>

			<h3>Safe Water</h3>
			<p>UVP's approach to safe water sources maximizes community ownership and minimizes the need for external funding. It has been highly successful in meeting the pressing needs for water in Iganga District.</p>
		</div>

		<div id='OF' class="col-xs-12">
			<h3>Obstetric Fistula</h3>
			<p>Fistula is one of the most devastating childbirth injuries. Prolonged obstructed labor can cause a hole in the birth canal which results in constant incontinence for the woman, isolating her from friends, family, and community. UVP promotes fistula awareness and prevention through community outreaches and brings women for surgery to heal their injury.</p>

			</div>
			<div id ="bgtext" class="col-xs-8"><h4>Background</h4>
			<p>Virtually unheard of in wealthier nations, obstetric fistula (Latin for hole) is an affliction of the very poor, and is predominantly caused by neglected, obstructed labor. If the obstruction is unrelieved, the baby usually dies. The prolonged impaction of its head against the mother’s internal tissue results in a severe medical condition in which a hole (fistula)  develops between either the rectum and vagina  or between the bladder and vagina.  The loss of the baby, the persistent incontinence and rank odor that follows, along with many other possible complications such as infertility and chronic infection, often conspire to isolate the woman from family, society, and employment. Though a simple surgical repair can mend most cases of obstetric fistula, most women go untreated, afraid to admit to the condition or too poor to afford the repair.
			Obstetric fistula is particularly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, and Uganda has been reported to have the third-highest rate of fistula in the world.</div>

<!-- 		<div  id="education" class="col-sm-6"><h4>Education</h4>
			<p>Through our outreach to traditional birth attendants and other healthcare workers in the Iganga District, we have learned that there are widespread misconceptions about obstetric fistula — for instance, that it is incurable, and that it is caused by a sexually transmitted infection. We working to combat these misconceptions through birth attendant education, through community educational outreaches, and through community drama group performances about fistula. Drama groups are a natural source for education on health issues, and are commonly utilized by Ugandan village communities.</p></div>
		<div id="Treatment" class="col-sm-6"><h4>Treatment</h4>
			<p>In order to repair women with fistula, we partner with a UK-based organization called Uganda Childbirth Injuries Fund. We first identify women with obstetric fistula though a number of avenues – village outreaches, health center referrals, radio shows, and simple word-of-mouth between women.  We then transport women three times a year to “repair camps” at Kamuli Mission Hospital, where they are repaired by surgeons from Uganda Childbirth Injuries Fund. In Uganda, all hospital patients must arrive with a friend to feed, attend and nurse them, and so we also transport one attendant for each patient. After surgery, we transport the women home (an important step, because if they go home by motorcycle taxi, or walk long distances, they risk re-opening their healing fistula). Our Fistula Coordinator follows up with the women after the surgery to check on her healing and social integration.</p></div> -->
